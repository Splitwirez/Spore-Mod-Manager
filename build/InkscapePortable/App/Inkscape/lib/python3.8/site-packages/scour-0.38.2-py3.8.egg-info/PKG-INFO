Description: 
        Scour is an SVG optimizer/cleaner that reduces the size of scalable
        vector graphics by optimizing structure and removing unnecessary data.
        
        It can be used to create streamlined vector graphics suitable for web
        deployment, publishing/sharing or further processing.
        
        The goal of Scour is to output a file that renderes identically at a
        fraction of the size by removing a lot of redundant information created
        by most SVG editors. Optimization options are typically lossless but can
        be tweaked for more agressive cleaning.
